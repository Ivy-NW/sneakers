Amana: Blockchain-Powered Sneaker Authentication Platform

A prototype implementation of the Amana sneaker authentication platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates core functionality including AI verification, payment processing, and Hedera blockchain integration to combat counterfeit sneakers in the marketplace.

Overview

Amana (meaning "trust" in Arabic) provides a comprehensive solution for authenticating sneakers using cutting-edge technology. This prototype showcases the key features of our service that leverages blockchain technology to create immutable verification certificates. Built with vanilla web technologies, it serves as a proof-of-concept before full-scale development.

Features
User registration and profile management
Role-based access (users, authenticators, admins)
Guided sneaker submission with photo upload interface
Simulated AI verification process with confidence scoring
Expert review interface for human verification
Credit-based payment system
Multiple payment options (HBAR, M-Pesa, PayPal)
Hedera blockchain certificate generation and storage
Certificate gallery and transfer capabilities
QR code generation for quick verification
Public verification portal for buyers
Technology Stack
HTML5 for structure and content
CSS3 with responsive design principles
Vanilla JavaScript for interactive functionality
Local Storage for data persistence during prototype testing
Hedera JavaScript SDK for blockchain integration
Mock APIs for payment simulation and AI verification
Custom UI components for seamless user experience
